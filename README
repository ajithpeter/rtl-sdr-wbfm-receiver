This was an attempt to build an FM Receiver using RTL SDR.  I had referred to a lot of sources while writing this one.  Most of the ideas were derived from the following references

1) rtl_fm : https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr
2) SDR Sharp : https://www.assembla.com/code/sdrsharp/subversion/nodes

Also the book by B.P.Lathi on Communication Systems provided a good overview on the fundamentals of FM Modulation.

There is a lot to improve on this one....
